# Airline-Sentiment
The Airline Sentiment Analysis Using NLP project leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze customer reviews of airlines and classify them into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. By preprocessing the textual data—cleaning, tokenizing, and lemmatizing—we ensure the text is ready for analysis. The project then applies machine learning models like Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Random Forest.The objective is to extract valuable insights into customer experiences, such as common themes related to delays, comfort, and customer service, which can help airlines improve their operations and customer satisfaction. The analysis is further enhanced with data visualization techniques to display sentiment distributions and trends, offering actionable insights for stakeholders to make data-driven decisions.
